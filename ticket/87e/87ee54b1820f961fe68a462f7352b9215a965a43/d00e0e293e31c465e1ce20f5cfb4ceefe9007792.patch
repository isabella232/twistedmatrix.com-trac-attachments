-Disable the garbage collector.  I don't know why this is in trial.
+Disable the garbage collector for the duration of the test run. As each test is
+run, trial collects the TestResult objects, which means that Python's garbage
+collector has more non-garbage objects to wade through, making each
+garbage-collection run slightly slower. Disabling garbage collection entirely
+will make some test suites complete faster (contrast --force-gc, below), at the
+cost of greatly increasing memory consumption. This option also makes tests
+slightly more deterministic, which might help debugging in extreme
