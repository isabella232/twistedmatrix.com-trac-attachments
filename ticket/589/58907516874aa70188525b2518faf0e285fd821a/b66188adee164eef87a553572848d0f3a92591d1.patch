 invoke trial.
+.PP
+After running the given test suite, the default test reporter prints a summary
+of the test run. This consists of the word "PASSED" (if all tests ran as
+expected) or "FAILED" (if any test behaved unexpectedly) followed by a count of
+the different kinds of test results encountered. The possible kinds of test
+results includes:
+.TP
+successes
+Tests that passed all their assertions and completed without error.
+These are marked "PASSED" in the normal test output.
+.TP
+failures
+Tests that failed an assertion, called self.fail() or explicitly raised
+self.failureException for some reason. These are marked "FAILED" in the
+normal test output.
+.TP
+errors
+Tests that raised an unexpected exception (including AssertionError),
+tests that caused the tearDown() method to raise an exception, tests
+that run for longer than the timeout interval, tests that caused
+something to call twisted.python.log.err() without subsequently calling
+self.flushLoggedErrors(), tests that leave the reactor in an unclean
+state, etc. These are marked "ERROR" in the normal test output.
+.IP
+Note that because errors can be caused after the actual test method
+returns, it is possible for a single test to be reported as both an
+error and a failure, and hence the total number of test results can be
+greater than the total number of tests executed.
+.TP
+skips
+Tests that were skipped, usually because of missing dependencies. These
+are marked "SKIPPED" in the normal test output.
+.TP
+expectedFailures
+Tests that failed, but were expected to fail, usually because the test
+is for a feature that hasn't been implemented yet. These are marked
+"TODO" in the normal test output.
+.TP
+unexpectedSuccesses
+Tests that should have been listed under expectedFailures, except that
+for some reason the test succeeded. These are marked "SUCCESS!?!" in
+the normal test output.
