-        This indicates peer did half-close of write side. It is now
-        the responsiblity of the this protocol to call
-        loseConnection().  In addition, the protocol MUST make sure a
-        reference to it still exists (i.e. by doing a callLater with
-        one of its methods, etc.)  as the reactor will only have a
-        reference to it if it is writing.
+        This indicates that the peer has closed its write side.
+        It will now be this protocol's responsiblity to ensure loseConnection()
+        gets called.
 
-        If the protocol does not do so, it might get garbage collected
-        without the connectionLost method ever being called.
+        In addition, a reference to this protocol MUST be kept alive somewhere
+        or there will be no way to trigger writing. This is because there will
+        be no further dataReceived() events to rely on as the reactor will
+        not hold references to related file descriptors.
+        
+        Not keeping a live reference to this protocol may result in it
+        being garbage collected without connectionLost() getting called.
