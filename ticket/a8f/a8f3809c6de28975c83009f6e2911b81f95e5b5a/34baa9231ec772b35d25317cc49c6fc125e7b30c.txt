resource.Resource - "A web-accessible resource." Since this schema isn't what most people are used to you could consider a class inheriting from resource.Resource a mechanism for rendering a web page or server side script. 

This can be demonstrated in this basic example:

from twisted.web import server, resource
from twisted.internet import reactor

class Simple(resource.Resource):
	isLeaf = True
	def render_GET(self, request):
		return "<html>Hello, world!</html>"


site = server.Site(Simple())
reactor.listenTCP(8080, site)
reactor.run()
