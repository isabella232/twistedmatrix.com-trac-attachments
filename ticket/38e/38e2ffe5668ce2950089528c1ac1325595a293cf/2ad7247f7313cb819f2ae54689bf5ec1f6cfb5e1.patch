 .SH DESCRIPTION
 .PP
 trial loads and executes a suite of unit tests, obtained from modules,
 packages and files listed on the command line.
 .PP
 trial will take either filenames or fully qualified Python names as
-arguments.  Thus 'trial myproject/foo.py', 'trial myproject.foo' and
- 'trial myproject.foo.SomeTestCase.test_method' are all valid ways to
+arguments.  Thus `trial myproject/foo.py', `trial myproject.foo' and
+`trial myproject.foo.SomeTestCase.test_method' are all valid ways to
 invoke trial.

 \fB--coverage\fR
-Generate coverage information in _trial_temp/coverage/. Requires Python 2.3
-or higher.
+Generate coverage information in the `coverage' subdirectory of the trial temp
+directory (`_trial_temp' by default). For each Python module touched by the
+execution of the given tests, a file will be created in the coverage directory
+named for the module's fully-qualified name with the suffix `.cover'.  For
+example, because the trial test runner is written in Python, the coverage
+directory will almost always contain a file named `twisted.trial.runner.cover'.
+
+Each `.cover' file contains a copy of the Python source of the module in
+question, with a prefix at the beginning of each line containing coverage
+information.  For lines that are not executable (blank lines, comments, etc.)
+the prefix is blank.  For executable lines that were run in the course of the
+test suite, the prefix is a number indicating the number of times that line was
+executed.  The string `>>>>>>' prefixes executable lines that were not executed
+in the course of the test suite.
+
+Note that this functionality uses Python's sys.settrace() function, so tests
+that call sys.settrace() themselves are likely to break trial's coverage
+functionality.
