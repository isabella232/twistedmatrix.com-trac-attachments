 """
+The reactor is the core of the event loop within Twisted 
+-- the loop which drives applications using Twisted. The
+reactor provides basic interfaces to a number of services,
+including network communications, threading, and event
+dispatching.
+
+The default reactor is the L{selectreactor
+<twisted.internet.selectreactor>}. This alias works for
+any reactor that is installed, and is installed when the
+reactor.install() method is called.
