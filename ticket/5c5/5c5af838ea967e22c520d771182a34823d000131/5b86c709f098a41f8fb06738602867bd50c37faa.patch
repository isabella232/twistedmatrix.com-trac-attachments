     <p>PyUnit provides a large number of assertion methods to be used when
     writing tests.  Many of these are redundant.  For consistency, Twisted
     unit tests should use the <code>assert</code> forms rather than the
-    <code>fail</code> forms and the singular names rather than the plural
-    names.  For example, don't use <code>failUnlessEqual</code>, use <code>
-    assertEqual</code> and don't use <code>assertNotEquals</code>, use
-    <code>assertNotEqual</code>.  <code>assertTrue</code> is also preferred
-    over <code>assert_</code>.  You may notice this convention is not
-    followed everywhere in the Twisted codebase.  If you are changing some
-    test code and notice the wrong method being used in nearby code, feel
-    free to adjust it.</p>
